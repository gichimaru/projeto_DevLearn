**Description**

TuscanoTask is a personal exercise project created as the final assignment for the HTML course by Codelab DevLearn. It is a web-based To-Do List application inspired by USP São Carlos traditions: "TUSCA" refers to the university games, and the toucan mascot is a playful symbol of our institute.
